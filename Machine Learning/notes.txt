K-means algorithm
Step 1: intialize K Centroids
    > Randomly select the intial Centroid locations
    > Use the first K data points as the Centroid

Step 2: Asign each data point to a cluster based on the proximity to the centroid
    > arg Minimum(k) = Distance(from x(i) to Centroid(k))

Step 3: Recalculate the new Centroids.
    > NewCentroids(k) = 1 / {N(k)Sum(x(i)) for all x(i) belonging to the cluster k}

Step 4: Stop when converge, else go back to step 2
